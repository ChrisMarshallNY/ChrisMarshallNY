# HI, I'm Chris Marshall

<img src="https://github.com/ChrisMarshallNY/ChrisMarshallNY/raw/master/Portrait.png" align="right" />

I'm an experienced software developer, specializing in Apple development ([native Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/)).

I've done a **LOT** of open-source code (I was a manager, for most of my career, and needed to keep my "tech chops" up), so I have [a fairly significant open track record](https://stackoverflow.com/story/chrismarshall).

I've been writing Apple software since 1986, and have released over 20 iOS, Mac, Watch and TV apps since 2012 (Many have been deprecated. [Here are the current ones](https://littlegreenviper.com/AppDocs/)). I've been releasing apps, written in Swift, since 2014.

I've written device drivers for [MIDI](https://www.midi.org), [IEEE-488](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE-488), [SCSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCSI), [USB](https://www.usb.org), [Bluetooth](https://www.bluetooth.com), Serial, Ethernet, and WiFi interfaces; sometimes, in [Assembly Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language) and/or [Machine Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code).

I've written [ONVIF](https://onvif.org) software [for Apple devices](https://github.com/RiftValleySoftware/RVS_ONVIF), and also [OBD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-board_diagnostics) software [for Apple devices](https://github.com/RiftValleySoftware/RVS_GTDriver).

I've written embedded operating systems, and have [designed electronic devices](https://littlegreenviper.com/TF30194/TF30194-Manual-1987.pdf) _(Downloads a PDF document)_.

I've coded in a number of languages, and used many development and target environments, but, the last few years, I've stuck with [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift), and [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), to write apps for all of the Apple operating systems ([iOS](https://apple.com/ios), [iPadOS](https://apple.com/ipados), [MacOS](https://apple.com/macos), [WatchOS](https://apple.com/watchos), and [TVOS](https://apple.com/tvos)).

I'm pretty good with hardware, and talking to devices, having started out as an EE. I don't mind WireShark dumps (too much).

I've created many [custom UI elements](https://github.com/RiftValleySoftware/RVS_Spinner), including [CDEFs](https://mirror.informatimago.com/next/developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/Toolbox/Toolbox-306.html) and [WDEFs](http://mirror.informatimago.com/next/developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/Toolbox/Toolbox-290.html#HEADING290-0).

I've written a great deal of prose, which includes [tutorials](https://littlegreenviper.com/series/bluetooth/), books, and [many articles on the Web](https://littlegreenviper.com/miscellany/). I've also done technical training for years.

In addition to all of the above, I've authored a number of server-based and "full-stack" systems; including (but not limited to) content-management systems, open-source libraries and modules, mobile apps, SDKs, APIs, and [application servers](https://riftvalleysoftware.com/work/open-source-projects/#baobab).

[I'm also pretty big on documentation.](https://littlegreenviper.com/miscellany/leaving-a-legacy/)

# I'm not famous

I've done a lot of stuff, but it hasn't made any "big splashes" in the field. I'm just another schlub with a GitHub account (but an unusually "green" one. See below), and I am quite current, with my last commit, likely, a few minutes ago.

# I'm Easy to Find

I have two small corporate sites: [The Great Rift Valley Software Company](https://riftvalleysoftware.com), and [Little Green Viper Software Development LLC](https://littlegreenviper.com). They each have simple contact forms that will send email to me directly.

# I Like to Help People Help People

I enjoy developing software. To me, it's a joy and a privilege. The job is really just an excuse to play, so writing open-source software is not something that feels like a "chore," in any way.

Also, I grew up in Africa, and learned, quite early in life, that I have it real good, and a **LOT** of people don't have it so good.

I always dreamed that, one day, i'd have the ability to help people in in need.

Software is that way, for me. I've written some software to help out NPOs (I won't link to it directly, but it shouldn't be too hard to figure it out. I'm not ashamed, but we don't really go out of our way to self-promote over the system), and I'm looking at doing more.

I'm interested in helping nonprofits and NGOs that are involved in helping people in need.

My GitHub ID, on its own, doesn't really have much in it. Most of the action is in the organizational accounts I'm connected to:

- [Little Green Viper Software Develoment LLC](https://github.com/LittleGreenViper) (I am the owner of this organization)
- [The Great Rift Valley Software Company](https://github.com/RiftValleySoftware) (I am the owner of this organization)
- [BMLT Enabled](https://github.com/bmlt-enabled) (This is very much a team effort, and I am only a contributor, here)
