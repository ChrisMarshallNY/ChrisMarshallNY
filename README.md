# HI, I'm Chris Marshall

<img src="https://github.com/ChrisMarshallNY/ChrisMarshallNY/raw/master/Portrait.png" align="right" />

I'm an experienced software developer, specializing in Apple development ([native Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/)).

I've been writing software since 1983, and Apple software since 1986.

During my entire career, I have worked on open-source code, and have [a **HUGE** portfolio and general track record](https://stackoverflow.com/story/chrismarshall).

I've been writing Mac applications since 1986, and have released over 20 [iOS, Mac, Watch and TV apps](https://littlegreenviper.com/AppDocs/) since 2012.

I've written device drivers for [MIDI](https://www.midi.org), [IEEE-488](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE-488), [SCSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCSI), [USB](https://www.usb.org), [Bluetooth](https://www.bluetooth.com), Serial, Ethernet, and WiFi interfaces; sometimes, in [Assembly Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language) and/or [Machine Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code).

I've written [ONVIF](https://onvif.org) software [for Apple devices](https://github.com/RiftValleySoftware/RVS_ONVIF), and also [OBD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-board_diagnostics) software [for Apple devices](https://github.com/RiftValleySoftware/RVS_GTDriver).

I've written embedded operating systems, and have [designed electronic devices](https://littlegreenviper.com/TF30194/TF30194-Manual-1987.pdf) _(Downloads a PDF document)_.

I'm pretty good with hardware, and talking to devices, having started out as an EE. I don't mind WireShark dumps (too much).

I have created many [custom UI elements](https://github.com/RiftValleySoftware/RVS_Spinner), including [CDEFs](https://mirror.informatimago.com/next/developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/Toolbox/Toolbox-306.html) and [WDEFs](http://mirror.informatimago.com/next/developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/Toolbox/Toolbox-290.html#HEADING290-0).

I've written a great deal of prose, which includes [tutorials](https://littlegreenviper.com/series/bluetooth/), books, and [many articles on the Web](https://littlegreenviper.com/miscellany/). I have also done technical training for years.

In addition to all of the above, I have authored many "full-stack" systems; which included Web sites, content-management systems, open-source libraries and modules, documentation, support Web sites, iOS app clients, SDKs and APIs.

# I'm not famous

I've done a lot of stuff, but it hasn't made any "big splashes" in the field. I'm just another schlub with a GitHub account (but an unusually "green" one. See below), and I am quite current, with my last commit, likely, a few minutes ago.

# I'm Easy to Find

I have two small corporate sites: [The Great Rift Valley Software Company](https://riftvalleysoftware.com), and [Little Green Viper Software Development LLC](https://littlegreenviper.com). They each have simple contact forms that will send email to me directly.

# I Like to Help People Help People

I enjoy developing software. To me, it's a joy and a privilege. The job is really just an excuse to play, so writing open-source software is not something that feels like a "chore," in any way.

Also, I grew up in Africa, and learned, quite early in life, that I have it real good, and a **LOT** of people don't have it so good.

I always dreamed of, one day, having the ability to help people in in need.

Software is one way. I've written some software to help out NPOs (I won't link to it directly, but it shouldn't be too hard to figure it out. I'm not ashamed, but we don't really go out of our way to self-promote over the system), and I'm looking at doing more.

I'm interested in helping nonprofits and NGOs that are involved in helping people in need.

My GitHub ID, on its own, doesn't really have much in it. Most of the action is in the organizational accounts I'm connected to:

- [Little Green Viper Software Develoment LLC](https://github.com/LittleGreenViper) (I am the owner of this organization)
- [The Great Rift Valley Software Company](https://github.com/RiftValleySoftware) (I am the owner of this organization)
- [BMLT Enabled](https://github.com/bmlt-enabled) (This is very much a team effort, and I am only a contributor, here)
