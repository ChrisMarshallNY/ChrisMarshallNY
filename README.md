# HI, I'm Chris Marshall

<img src="https://github.com/ChrisMarshallNY/ChrisMarshallNY/raw/master/Portrait.png" align="right" />

I'm an experienced software developer, specializing in Apple development ([native Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/)).

I've been writing software since 1984, and Apple software since 1986.

I started with [Machine Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code), directly embedded in digital devices, then migrated to writing software for workstations and personal computers. I had my first job, doing "pure software," in 1987 (Dialcom), which was a "big iron" shop. I fairly quickly moved over to General Electric Information Systems, where I worked as a Macintosh developer.

In 1990, I moved to New York, to work for [Nikon Inc.](https://www.nikonusa.com) –The US presence of [the Nikon Corporation](https://nikon.com).

I worked at Nikon for almost 27 years; 25 of them as a manager of a small, high-functioning software development team that mainly worked on "engine" –[(Image processing "pipeline")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_image_pipeline) code; mostly in C++.

During my entire career, I have worked on open-source code, and have [a **HUGE** portfolio and general track record](https://stackoverflow.com/story/chrismarshall), consisting of hundreds of thousands of lines of code, dozens of repos, Web site/blog entries/articles, over a decade of commit history, and [many shipping apps](https://littlegreenviper.com/AppDocs/).

I've written Mac applications since 1986, device drivers, custom UI elements, "full-stack" systems, including iOS app clients, Web sites, content-management systems, open-source libraries and modules, SDKs and APIs, training courses, tutorials, books, and many articles on the Web.

I'm not famous.

I've done a lot of stuff, but it hasn't made any "big splashes."

# I'm Easy to Find

I have two small corporate sites: [The Great Rift Valley Software Company](https://riftvalleysoftware.com), and [Little Green Viper Software Development LLC](https://littlegreenviper.com). They each have simple contact forms that will send email to me directly.

# I Like to Help People Help People

I enjoy developing software. To me, it's a joy and a privilege. The job is really just an excuse to play, so writing open-source software is not something that feels like a "chore," in any way.

Also, I grew up in Africa, and learned, quite early in life, that I have it real good, and a **LOT** of people don't have it so good.

I always dreamed of, one day, having the ability to help people in in need.

Software is one way. I've written some software to help out NPOs (I won't link to it directly, but it shouldn't be too hard to figure it out. I'm not ashamed, but we don't really go out of our way to self-promote over the system), and I'm looking at doing more.

I'm interested in helping nonprofits and NGOs that are involved in helping people in need.
